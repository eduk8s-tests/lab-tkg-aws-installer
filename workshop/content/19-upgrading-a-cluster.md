Kubernetes is constantly being developed and new versions being released on a regular basis.

Using ``tkg`` you can do in place upgrades using the ``tkg upgrade`` command.

We will not be showing how the upgrade process works here, but you can find more details in:

The general procedure is to first upgrade any management clusters. Once that has been done then you can start to upgrade the workload clusters.
